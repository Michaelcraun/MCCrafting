Purpose to come!

## Installation
Installation of this collection of recipes can be accomplished by simply cloning
the repo and running the `unpack.sh` shell script, passing it the directory of
your world's datapacks directory. (i.e., `./unpack.sh ~/server/world/datapacks`)

This command will copy the needed contents of this recipe collection to your
datapacks directory and deletes the cloned directory after installation. After
this is complete, simply restarting your world or using the `/reload` command
will update your datapacks.

## Updates
This recipe collection will receive periodic updates. To install these updates,
the `update_recipes.sh` shell script can be called from inside your world's
datapacks directory. This will automatically follow the installation process as
described above, getting you the latest changes.

**NOTE:** Updating this recipe collection still requires you to restart or
reload your world to update the world's datapacks.

## Definitions

## Recipes
This Minecraft datapack includes several quality-of-life recipes that have been
broken up into the groups listed below.

### Alternate Crafting
Alternate (potentially better) recipes for crafting in-game items.

Better Trapdoors 

The default recipes for crafting trapdoors now produce 12 wooden or 6 iron 
trapdoors. **NOTE:** This recipe does not currently work for crimson and warped
trapdoors (this seems to be a bug in 1.18).
